# Product-Analysis-Using-PowerBI
Welcome to my git project "Product Analysis"!

In this project, I have cleaned the Apocolypse Food dataset and analyzed the prices of different products from Target, Costco, Jewel Osco, and Walmart. 
I have generated a report that shows the best places to buy cheap products based on their prices.

Using the cleaned data, I have created a dashboard that highlights the best place to buy any product. 
After analyzing the prices from different stores, I found that Costco is the best place to buy any product due to its competitive pricing.

I hope this project will help you make informed decisions about where to buy your products and save you money. 
Feel free to explore the data, report, and dashboard in the repository.
